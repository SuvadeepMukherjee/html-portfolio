<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there, I'm Suvadeep Mukherjee! I've got a Mechanical Engineering degree
  under my belt, but right now, I'm knee-deep in the world of web development.
  You'll often find me tapping away at the keyboard, crafting lines of code with
  a cup of coffee by my side. When I'm not in the coding zone, you'll catch me
  cheering for my favorite football team on game nights.

  Apart from tech and sports, I'm a huge fan of podcasts and music. They're my
  go-to when I want to unwind or get some fresh ideas. Oh, and remember that
  class 12 mathematics exam? I managed to snag a score of 97 out of 100! It's a
  small win, but it's a reminder that hard work pays off. Here's to more coding,
  football, and maybe a few more victories along the way!
